    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // one day
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Woo Hoo!';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Stayin\' alive!';
    console.log(team5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Jordan Jordan',
      age: 10
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
    console.log(capt2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    //const capt3 = {...person}; //coming soon...
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
